      <p>This Useless Box was designed according to design specifications outlined in the 
          Project Assignment page found on our classroom Canvas page.  This includes using 
          an Arduino, a micro Servo motor, battery pack, LED power indicator, and two switches.  
          A Useless Box is a device that accepts input from a user through the use of a switch.  
          Once the switch is engaged, the box responds by clicking the switch back to its original 
          position.  In order to add some personality to my project, I decided to make the box as 
          small as possible. </p>

      <p>As I began planning the design of my useless box, I wanted to challenge myself by making 
          the box as small as possible, while still containing all of the components and battery.  
          After several iterations that included reorienting the location of the Arduino and 9V 
          battery, I finally settled on a layout that had the Arduino installed vertically on a 
          wall opposite from the 9V Battery and Servo Motor mount.  This allowed for enough space 
          for the swing arm to move freely in order to make contact with the switch mounted on the 
          top of the box.</p>
          <p>While creating the CAD model, it was important to include all standard components 
              that would be used during assembly.  This would ensure that after laser cutting the 
              acrylic pieces and 3D printing the remaining custom parts everything would fit as 
              desired.  Thankfully each of the electronic components are already available for use 
              within our schools Onshape account.</p>
        <p>Overall size of the mini-Box design is 87mm x 70mm x 64mm (L x W x H).</p>

      <p>This program was written on the Arduino IDE.  The logic was fairly straightforward and 
          included a single if else statement.  In order to control the servo motors, I needed 
          to import the Servo.h library.  The if condition asks if the switchstate was LOW.  If 
          this resolves as true, then the servo arm moves in order to hit the switch and change 
          the switchstate back to HIGH.  As soon as this occurs, the else condition is satisfied 
          and the servo arm moves back to its original position.  In addition to the servo arm 
          commands, I also included print outs to the Serial Monitor to ensure everything was 
          working properly.</p>

      <p>Useless Box is the unfortunate name associated with this project.  Completing this 
          project is anything but useless.  Through this project I gained a greater appreciation 
          for how important it is to have a lot of detail in my CAD model.  If I didnâ€™t try to make 
          my model as accurate as possible I would have definitely run into issues during assembly.  
          Thankfully I only had to cut my acrylic pieces once and everything snapped into place 
          perfectly!</p>
    <p>The Useless Box project is the first project for our Engineering 1 students.  It is 
        typically the first time a student completes a full cycle of the Engineering Design
        Process.  Although it is a cognitive leap for students to move from the design phase 
        to the build phase, my role as teacher is to support and push students out of their 
        comfort zone.  Successfully completing this project is a huge step for many of our 
        students, but once they achieve this goal they are ready to take on any new challenge 
        they may face.</p>
